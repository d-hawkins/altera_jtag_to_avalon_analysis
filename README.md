# Introduction

This repository contains the original version of the JTAG-to-Avalon-MM analysis document created using Altera Quartus II 11.1sp1 in February 2012. The repository contains the internal details of the Altera JTAG components, and is referenced by the JTAG-to-Avalon-MM tutorial that I also uploaded to github in May 2023 (see https://github.com/d-hawkins/altera_jtag_to_avalon_mm_tutorial).
